<p>Practising HTML is fun. So far we have learned HTML is a language made of tags that help us describe 
how we want our webpage to look. We have tried the head title. 
H (heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tags in HTML.
<br> Most importantly even if you have the ENTER buttom pressed in the par tag the webpage displayed will not take the BREAK unles the actual tag is used.
<br> But that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. 
We can learn the new tags when we need them.</p>
